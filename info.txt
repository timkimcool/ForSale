Practicing networking and JavaFX by designing board game ForSale based on UI from board game arena.

--Setting up network--
Server Side:
1. Create serverSocket to accept client sockets: serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT)
2. Set up socket listener: Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
3. Create data/object input and output streams: new DataOutputStream(socket);
4. Write data/object; in order to send object, object must implement serializable. For fields that cannot be sent over streams, mark them as transient. Then create private writeObject classes to manually serialize fields to send over and then readObject class to deserialize fields from the client.
Client side:
1. Create socket and connect to host: socket = new Socket(HOST, PORT);
2. Create data/object input and output streams
3. receive data/object; see ServerSide step 4.
